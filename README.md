   Combining Direct Supervision | DSRE

   > This paper combines direct supervision and distant supervision. It innovatively uses direct supervision for training sigmoid attention in a multi-task way. Further, when applying to the CNN backbone with different filter sizes, adding entity embedding as additional inputs is a useful trick, which performs comparable to RESIDE and better than PCNN-ATT. After combining the supervised sigmoid attention, this paper become a new sota.
